A Python function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can take in input parameters, perform some operations, and return a result. In the example above, `my_function` is defined as a function with no input parameters and no return value. The code inside the function is denoted by indentation and is executed when the function is called.

To use the function, you can simply call it by its name followed by parentheses, like this: `my_function()`. This will execute the code inside the function.

You can also define functions with input parameters by specifying them inside the parentheses after the function name. For example: `def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):`. Inside the function, you can then use these parameters to perform operations.

If you want the function to return a value, you can use the `return` statement followed by the value you want to return. For example: `return result`. The returned value can then be assigned to a variable or used in other parts of your code.

Functions are a fundamental building block in Python programming as they allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces of code. They promote code reuse and make your code more modular and organized.
