# python

python is a programming language which is very close to human language and because of that it is easy to learn and use. Python is used by various industries and companies (including Google). It has been used to develop web applications, desktop applications, system adminstration, and machine learning libraries. Python is highly embraced language in the data science and machine learning community.

## Variables

Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name (like x, y, z), but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended.

Python Variable Name Rules

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)

annonymous function in python 

- Small, unnamed functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.
- Can take any number of arguments but only have one expression, which is evaluated and returned.
- Useful for short, simple functions that are often used temporarily or passed as arguments to other functions.

**Syntax:**

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y  # Adds two numbers
result = add(5, 3)  # Calls the function, result will be 8
```

**Here's a comprehensive explanation of anonymous functions (lambda functions) in Python:**

**What are they?**

- Small, unnamed functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.
- Can take any number of arguments but only have one expression, which is evaluated and returned.
- Useful for short, simple functions that are often used temporarily or passed as arguments to other functions.

**Syntax:**

**Python**

```python
lambda arguments: expression

```

**Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

**Example:**

**Python**

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y  # Adds two numbers
result = add(5, 3)  # Calls the function, result will be 8

```

**Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**

**Common use cases:**

- **Sorting:**
    
    **Python**
    
    ```python
    numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2]
    numbers.sort(key=lambda x: x**2)  # Sort by square of numbers
    
    ```
    
    **Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**
    
- **Filtering:**
    
    **Python**
    
    ```python
    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))  # Filter even numbers
    
    ```
    
    **Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**
    
- **Mapping:**
    
    **Python**
    
    ```python
    doubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))  # Double each number
    
    ```
    
    **Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**
    
- **Using with other functions:**
    
    **Python**
    
    ```python
    max_value = max(numbers, key=lambda x: abs(x))  # Find maximum absolute value
    
    ```
    
    **Use code with caution. [Learn more](https://bard.google.com/faq#coding)content_copy**
    

**Key points:**

- Limited to a single expression.
- Can access variables from the surrounding scope.
- Often used for concise code and functional programming paradigms.
- Best for simple, short-term functions. For more complex tasks, use regular `def` functions.

encapsulation when a data can not be accessed directly we say encapsulation (binding data with function)

polymorphism poly means many and morphism means forms so it means many forms (a person have many identity in different places)

inheritance when a class can take the attribute and function (state and behavior of another class we say abstraction
