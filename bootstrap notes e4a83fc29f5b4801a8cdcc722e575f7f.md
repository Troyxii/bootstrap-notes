## Bootstrap Notes

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript components that make it easier to design and develop web pages.

Some key features of Bootstrap include:

- Responsive grid system: Bootstrap utilizes a flexible and responsive grid system that allows developers to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- Pre-styled components: Bootstrap provides a wide range of pre-styled components, such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, and more. These components can be easily customized to match the design of a website.
- JavaScript plugins: Bootstrap includes a set of JavaScript plugins that enhance the functionality of web pages. Examples of these plugins include carousels, modals, and dropdown menus.

Using Bootstrap can significantly speed up the development process and help create modern and visually appealing websites.

It is important to note that while Bootstrap provides a solid foundation for building websites, customization may be required to achieve a unique and tailored design.

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers located in different geographic locations that deliver web content to users based on their location. When a user requests a file, such as a CSS or JavaScript file, the CDN serves the file from the server that is closest to the user, ensuring faster delivery and improved performance. CDNs are commonly used to deliver static files, such as libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap, to websites.

**Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.**

â€¢   **Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.**Â Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.

- **Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.**Â Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly useÂ `min-width`Â in our media queries.
- **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.**Â Bootstrapâ€™s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.

## **Available breakpoints**

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to asÂ *grid tiers*, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if youâ€™re using our source Sass files.

| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra small | None | <576px |
| Small | sm | â‰¥576px |
| Medium | md | â‰¥768px |
| Large | lg | â‰¥992px |
| Extra large | xl | â‰¥1200px |
| Extra extra large | xxl | â‰¥1400px |

Containers

Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and areÂ **required when using our default grid system**. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containersÂ *can*Â be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

- `.container`, which sets aÂ `max-width`Â at each responsive breakpoint
- `.container-{breakpoint}`, which isÂ `width: 100%`Â until the specified breakpoint
- `.container-fluid`, which isÂ `width: 100%`Â at all breakpoints

The table below illustrates how each containerâ€™sÂ `max-width`Â compares to the originalÂ `.container`Â andÂ `.container-fluid`Â across each breakpoint.

Responsive containers 

allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we applyÂ `max-width`s for each of the higher breakpoints. For example,Â `.container-sm`Â is 100% wide to start until theÂ `sm`Â breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up withÂ `md`,Â `lg`,Â `xl`, andÂ `xxl`.

```html
<div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>
```

GRID

important points about the grid system 

- **Our grid supportsÂ [six responsive breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/).**Â Breakpoints are based onÂ `min-width`Â media queries, meaning they affect that breakpoint and all those above it (e.g.,Â `.col-sm-4`Â applies toÂ `sm`,Â `md`,Â `lg`,Â `xl`, andÂ `xxl`). This means you can control container and column sizing and behavior by each breakpoint.
- **Containers center and horizontally pad your content.**Â UseÂ `.container`Â for a responsive pixel width,Â `.container-fluid`Â forÂ `width: 100%`Â across all viewports and devices, or a responsive container (e.g.,Â `.container-md`) for a combination of fluid and pixel widths.
- **Rows are wrappers for columns.**Â Each column has horizontalÂ `padding`Â (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. ThisÂ `padding`Â is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. Rows also support modifier classes toÂ [uniformly apply column sizing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#row-columns)Â andÂ [gutter classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/gutters/)Â to change the spacing of your content.
- **Columns are incredibly flexible.**Â There are 12 template columns available per row, allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span any number of columns. Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g.,Â `col-4`Â spans four).Â `width`s are set in percentages so you always have the same relative sizing.
- **Gutters are also responsive and customizable.**Â [Gutter classes are available](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/gutters/)Â across all breakpoints, with all the same sizes as ourÂ [margin and padding spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/). Change horizontal gutters withÂ `.gx-*`Â classes, vertical gutters withÂ `.gy-*`, or all gutters withÂ `.g-*`Â classes.Â `.g-0`Â is also available to remove gutters.
- **Sass variables, maps, and mixins power the grid.**Â If you donâ€™t want to use the predefined grid classes in Bootstrap, you can use ourÂ [gridâ€™s source Sass](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#sass-variables)Â to create your own with more semantic markup. We also include some CSS custom properties to consume these Sass variables for even greater flexibility for you.

grid with breakpoints

Bootstrapâ€™s grid system can adapt across all six default breakpoints, and any breakpoints you customize. The six default grid tiers are as follows:

- Extra small (xs)
- Small (sm)
- Medium (md)
- Large (lg)
- Extra large (xl)
- Extra extra large (xxl)

Row Columns

Use the responsiveÂ `.row-cols-*`Â classes to quickly set the number of columns that best render your content and layout. Whereas normalÂ `.col-*`Â classes apply to the individual columns (e.g.,Â `.col-md-4`), the row columns classes are set on the parentÂ `.row`Â as a shortcut. WithÂ `.row-cols-auto`Â you can give the columns their natural width.

```html
<div class="container text-center">
  <div class="row row-cols-2">
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Nesting

To nest your content with the default grid, add a newÂ `.row`Â and set ofÂ `.col-sm-*`Â columns within an existingÂ `.col-sm-*`Â column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).

```html
<div class="container text-center">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      Level 1: .col-sm-3
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-9">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8 col-sm-6">
          Level 2: .col-8 .col-sm-6
        </div>
        <div class="col-4 col-sm-6">
          Level 2: .col-4 .col-sm-6
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
