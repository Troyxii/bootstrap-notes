• Use our [spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/) and [flex](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/flex/) utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.

**Navbars come with built-in support for a handful of sub-components. Choose from the following as needed:**

- `.navbar-brand` for your company, product, or project name.
- `.navbar-nav` for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns).
- `.navbar-toggler` for use with our collapse plugin and other [navigation toggling](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/#responsive-behaviors) behaviors.
- Flex and spacing utilities for any form controls and actions.
- `.navbar-text` for adding vertically centered strings of text.
- `.collapse.navbar-collapse` for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.
- Add an optional `.navbar-scroll` to set a `max-height` and [scroll expanded navbar content](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/#scrolling).
